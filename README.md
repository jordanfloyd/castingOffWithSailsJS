=====================

Code from Casting Off with Sails.js at Triangle JS meetup

This is the code from the creatureFighter application shown at the Triangle JS meetup.

This code is intended to serve as an example of how you could build an application in Sails.js. It does not necessarily follow best practices in an attempt to keep the example simple and only use one model and controller. A few different methods were used for retriving data to show the range of possibilities. In your applications, you should pick a certain method syntax and be consistent with it.
